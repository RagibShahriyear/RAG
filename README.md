# RAG2B

 -> A RAG pipeline *built from scratch* with the Gemma2B model. 
 -> This pipeline will take a pdf (or any kinds of text/documents, really), then format and embed them, then will send the embeddings **(relevant parts of the query from the document, as context)** with the query to Gemma2B model (or any!) and then generate answers based on the query and context!
